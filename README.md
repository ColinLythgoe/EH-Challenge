# EH-Challenge
Similar to LC-Word Search II, given an 8x8 array of characters and a list of words as input, output the longest word from the list that can be constructed from the grid while moving around the grid as if you're a knight in chess.

After, use the text extracted from a Shakespeare play to construct the input word list and find the longest word.
